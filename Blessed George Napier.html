      <h1>His Early Life</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">George Napier was born in the Old Manor House, Holywell, just outside the walls of Oxford City in the year 1548.
	  He was a son of Edward Napper (died in 1558), sometime Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, by Anne, his second wife, daughter of John Peto, of Chesterton, Warwickshire, and niece of Cardinal William Peto.
	  He attended and studied at the Oxford Grammar School and went on to continue his studies to Corpus Christi College on the  5 January 1566, but was ejected in 1568 as a recusantâ€“someone who refused to attend Anglican services. 
	  This happened because in 1568 George Napier opposed Queen Elizabeth's nomination of a renegade Catholic, William Cole, as President of the College. George and two friends nominated 
	  Robert Harrison who was favourable to Catholicism. The Queen forced the College to elect her Candidate and expelled George Napier and his friends.
	  He returned to Holywell and built a house with his brother William on some property they owned in Cowley as a place of shelter for priests.</h5>

      <h1>Getting Imprisoned and Ordained</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32"> In 1579 George went overseas to the English College at Rheims to continue his Catholic Education and perhaps with the intention of becoming a Priest. A year later in 1580 he was arrested with three other Laymen and St.Ralph 
	  Sherwin. We do not know how long he remained in prison for his Faith. We do know that nine years later in 1588 he was in the Counter Prison, Chapside, London. As soon as he was free he went across to France to the English College at Douai to continue his 
	  studies for the Priesthood. He was later ordained at the age of 48. He became a Prefect of Studies and taught Humanities at the College for seven years.</h5>

      <h1>Missionary Life as a Secretive Priest</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">George Napier left France and returned back to Oxford on the death of Elizabeth in 1603. He lived at Holywell Manor and at Temple Cowley.
	  He worked as a missionary priest for another seven years, saying Mass, hearing Confessions and administering the other Sacraments to the Catholics in the area.
	  On the early morning of July 19th, 1610, Father George Napier was bringing Holy Communion to a sick person. He had on him a pyx containing two consecrated Hosts as well as a small reliquary and 
	  he was arrested in the village of Kirlington near Woodstock and brought before the Justice of the Peace at Heyford. He was strictly searched; but the constable found only his breviary, his holy oils, and a needle case with thread and thimble.</h5>

      <h1>The Death Of George Napier</h1>
	 
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The next day George Napier was lodged in the Bacardo Prison-North Gate of the City where he was moved to Oxford Castle and at
	  Autumn Assizes was condemned to death-to be hung, drawn and quarted because he was a Priest under act 27 Eliz., c. 2 against Jesuits(Seminary Priests). 
	  The possession of the oils was held to be conclusive and he was condemned, but reprieved. In gaol (jail) he reconciled a condemned felon named Falkner, and this was held to aggravate his crime,
	  but as late as 2 November it was believed that he would have his sentence commuted to one of banishment. As he refused the oath of allegiance, he was condemned to death. On hearing he was about to die he exclaimed "Welcome by God's grace and pray God I
	  may be constant." The night before his death he gave a little party to some of his friends with him in the prison and treated them well, taking for himself only a little pigeon pie and some prunes.</h5>

      <h1>The final moments of his life</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">On the morning of November 10th, 1610, he dressed himself in his best white suit and was then taken out, placed on a hurdle, and dragged to the gallows, and executed. He was 62 years of age.
	  On mounting the gallows he was told to confess his treason. "Treason, Sir" he said "I thank God I never knew what treason meant."
	  Then he prayed for the King said the "De Profundis" and his final words were "Into Thy Hands O Lord I commend my spirit" Many Protestants in the crowd 
	  weeping and these with the Catholics prevented the hangman from cutting him down and quartering him while he was still alive; indeed they ran forward and
	  pulled at him as he was hanging, so as to hasten his death and put him out of his agony the sooner. "He was much pitied" writes Anthony-a-Wood, "for that
	  his grey hairs would come to such an end, and lamented by many that such rigour should be shown on an innocent and harmless person". </h5>
	  
      <p class="w3-text-grey">He died on November 10th, 1610. His mutilated quarters were placed on the four gates of the City and his head on the gate of Christ
	  Church. The body of our martyr was collected together by his brother William and buried secretly in the Chapel of the Knights Templar, at Sandford-on-Thames. The picture below is of the Ceramic Plaque found on the outside wall
	  of the school. It tells us his story and celebrates his memory. It was blessed by Maurice Couve de Murville, the Seventh Archbishop of Birmingham, on Wednesday September 2nd 1992. The ceramic artist was Mr A Pope of Wolverhampton.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-padding-32"> Blessed George Napier was beatified in 1929 by Pope Pius XI. He was dedicated a Plaque on the wall of Oxford Castle which states "Close to this spot lies the site of the medieval gallows. In 1610 Blessed George
		Napier, Catholic Priest and Martyr, was executed here." The Plaque was blessed by Archbishop of Birmingham Bernard Longley around November 3rd 2010. </h5>
