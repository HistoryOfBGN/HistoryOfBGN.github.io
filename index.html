      <h1>The Purpose</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The purpose of this website should be clear, it is simply a library of information on the History of Blessed George Napier Catholic School and Sixth Form. The main objective of this website is to present the information
	  to the users in a materialistically designed and minimalistic way. This includes historical information from the early stages and developments of the School to the people behind the ideology's and themes we see on campus today. This was done by researching
		and gathering data from past members and looking around on site the Academy itself. The documentations and research that I have collected are all displayed here into one easy to read and visually appealing website. </h5>

      <h1>The Purpose and Reason</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">These are the reasons why I took on the challenge of developing a website on the historical information about the school for my Extended Project. I have always thought that the History of an institution is an important factor to be considered. I wanted to know more about the school and how it came to be, such as the opening dates and
		the developments of certain buildings like the Chapel. Also, the School website found online (As of 2017) is targeted at people in the present date as it offers updates and news of now and the future for the pupils, parents and members. 
	       Hence, I thought creating a website on the History of the School would be a great complimentary feature to the main website as my website delves a step further not just into the recent past but also the distant past.
	      Furthermore, it will be a way of protecting the fragile data by keeping a digital record of it online. These are the reasons why I took on the challenge of developing a website on the historical information about the school.</h5>

      <!-- <p class="w3-text-grey">This allowed me to not only use some of my basic knowledge in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and a tiny amount of JavaScript to develop a website. But also enabled me to provide something that
		I believe is useful to the school community and its members by treasuring this information on a digital scale. I believe it is natural as humans to be curious to know more about their background and where they came from and this website helps
	      in answering those particular questions. Moreover it helped me overcome some personal challenges such as being persistent and helped me develop time management skills.</p> -->
